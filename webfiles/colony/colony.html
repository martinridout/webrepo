<h2>Modelling fungal colony counts</h2>

<p>
One way of estimating concentrations of viable fungal spores in
soil is to mix a measured amount of soil with distilled water,
pour some of the mix onto agar plates, incubate these for a period
of time and then count the number of colonies that are
formed on the plate. When multiplied by an appropriate conversion
factor, this gives an estimate of the number of colony forming
units per gram of soil.</p>

<p>In principle, when using this method, the average number of 
colonies per plate should be proportional to the amount of soil
per plate. But in practice, it is common to find that the number
of colonies grows more slowly than linearly when the amount of soil
is increased. This can occur for various reasons. One possibility
is that colonies that grow from spores that are close together
on the plate coalesce and appear as a single colony. Another possibility
is that some spores are inhibited from growing by chemicals or
other inhibitory organisms that are present in the soil suspension.
</p>

<p>Various analyses of colony counts of the organism <i>Verticillium
dahliae</i>, which causes wilt in many crops, are published in two
papers described below. Details about the experimental data are given in [Ref 3].
</p>

<p>The first paper [Ref 1] was written with David Harris, the plant pathologist
who collected the data.
It considers various aspects of design and analysis 
in relation to a particular non-linear model. Whilst this model can
be derived as an approximate model arising from overlapping colonies,
the parameter estimates that we obtain are very different to those
that would be implied by the physical dimensions of the colonies and
in this application the model is best considered simply as an
empirical model that provides a good fit to the data.</p>

<p>
The second paper [Ref 2], joint with 
<a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/david-morris">David Morris</a>, 
presents a model of inhibition in which 
colonies fail to develop if spores are close to spores of other 
inhibitory species. The model has three parameters, but a limiting 
case of the model with only two parameters is shown to be more useful 
in practice. This latter model, which is a generalized linear model, 
is fitted to the <i>V. dahliae</i> counts and the model is contrasted 
with the earlier model.
