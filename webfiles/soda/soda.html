<h3>SODA: A software tool to assist in the design of single-season occupancy studies
</h3>

<p>
SODA is a tool developed to assist in the design of single-season occupancy
studies. It provides automated searches for suitable designs and can evaluate
the properties of specified designs. A key feature of SODA is that it uses
simulation to investigate the small sample properties of maximum likelihood
estimators, rather than relying on asymptotic approximations. The methodology
is described in Ref [1] below.
</p>

<p>
SODA is written in Matlab and is currently available only for Microsoft Windows. 
For R users, we have provided a separate 
<a href="occdesign1sp.R">R function</a>
that simulates the basic single
species occupancy model with given parameter values, assuming a given number of sampling
sites and visits per site, and displays the results in tabular form and graphically. 
Comments at the start of the function explain usage. This function can be used to compare
different designs 'manually', to mimic the automatic searches in the Matlab version.
</p>

<p>
SODA was written by 
<a href="https://gguilleraresearch.wordpress.com/about-me/">Gurutzeta Guillera-Arroita</a>, as part of her PhD in the 
Statistics group at Kent, supervised by 
<a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science/people/1127/morgan-byron">Byron Morgan</a>
and myself.
</p>

<h4>Downloading the software</h4><br>
<p>
For the Matlab version, you should start by reading the
<a href="Help_SODA.pdf">user guide</a>. The files that you
need to download depend on whether or not you have Matlab on your machine.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>If you have Matlab installed on your machine</h4>
<p>
The files you need are in this
<a href="SODA_v0_matlab_files.zip">zip file</a> (11KB).
</p>

</li>
<li>
<h4>If you DO NOT have Matlab installed on your machine</h4>

<p>
The files you need are in this
<a href="SODA_v0_files.zip">zip file</a> (133KB).
However, you will also need to download and install the
<a href="https://uk.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html">
Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR)</a> tool, unless you already have
the correct version (7.10) installed on your machine. Please consult these
<a href="readme.txt">detailed instructions</a> about what you
need to do.
For general information about this tool
see this <a href=https://uk.mathworks.com/help/compiler/index.html>Matlab webpage</a>.

</ul>
