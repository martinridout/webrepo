<h3>Tredoku tilings
</h3>

<p> 
Tredoku tilings were introduced by my friend and former colleague Donald Preece, who 
died in 2014. You can read about Donald's life and work 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.2220">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Tredoku tilings, were inspired by the tredoku puzzles that Donald encountered in the 
Times newspaper. Tredoku is a variant of sudoku on a layout that has a 3D appearance.
It was invented by 
<a href="https://israel21c.org/israeli-architect-invents-popular-sudoku-spin-off/">Eyal Amitzur</a>
and marketed by Mindome Ltd, who produced several books of puzzles that are mostly 
still in print.
</p>

<p>
The cover of one of these books is shown opposite, with an example of a tredoku puzzle.
Donald was interested in the structure that remains when we remove the numbers and the 3x3 grids,
as shown in the example opposite, and called this a <b>tredoku tiling</b>.
</p>

<p>An important property of a tredoku tiling is that every tile lies in either one or two <b>runs</b> 
of length 3. A run consists of a central tile that has tiles attached to two of its opposite edges. The 
tiling on the right has six runs as highlighted below:

Here are a few more tredoku tilings that Donald discovered:

</p>

<h4>When do tilings exist?</h4><br>

<p>
Donald was interested in identifying the combinations of number of tiles (&tau;) and
number of runs (&rho;) for which tilings exist. He proved that a necessary condition is
	<img src="inequality.jpg" class="aligncenter" width="309"
       height="50" alt="Inequality" />
and showed how to construct tredoku tilings for most combinations within this range. He conjectured
that tilings do not exist for the remaining combinations.
</p>

<p>
In 2024, <a href="https://simonblackburnmath.wordpress.com/">Simon Blackburn</a> 
gave a proof of Donald's conjecture [Ref 1]. The proof is quite intricate, the most
difficult part being 
to show that no tredoku tiling exists with 12 tiles and 8 runs.  
</p>

<h4>My contribution</h4><br>

<p>
I inherited Donald's work in this area, which consisted largely of hand drawn pictures
of tilings. I have eventually produced an archive of all of his 
<a href="Appendix_B.pdf">tredoku tilings</a>,
along with what he called 
<a href="Appendix_C.pdf">quadridoku</a> 
and <a href="Appendix_D.pdf">quindoku</a> tilings</a> 
(these are similar to tredoku tilings, but with runs of length 4 and 5 respectively).
</p>

<p>
These archives appear as appendices of [Ref 2], which explains the notation and 
annotations used. The paper gives an overview of Donald's work, but also includes
some new work, including alternative proofs of parts of Donald's conjecture,
a computer enumeration of the isomorphism classes of tredoku tilings with up to 16 tiles
and an introduction to tilings with holes. 
</p>

<p>
Donald didn't do any systematic investigation of tilings with holes, but he did
give a few nice examples (see Fig 9.9 in [Ref 2] for an explanation of the colour scheme):
