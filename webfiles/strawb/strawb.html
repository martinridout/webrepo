<h2>Modelling the branching structure of strawberry inflorescences</h2>

<p> 
This work, which was completed several years ago, was joint with 
<a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science/people/417/cole-diana">Diana
Cole</a> and 
<a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science/people/1127/morgan-byron">Byron Morgan</a>
at Kent and stemmed from a 
collaboration with David Taylor, formerly of East Malling Research.
</p>

<p> 
The flowers of the cultivated strawberry occur on branched structures
called inflorescences. 
A single plant may produce several inflorescences
during a growing season.
</p>
<p>
Botanically, the branching structure is a <I>dichasium</I>. The main axis of the
inflorescence terminates with a single primary (or rank 1) flower. Two lateral branches
emanate from the main axis, each terminating in a rank 2 flower. Similarly,
from each of these branches, two further lateral branches arise, each
terminating in a rank 3 flower, and so on. Ideally then there is a single
rank 1 flower, two rank 2 flowers, four rank 3 flowers and so on. 
</p>

<p>
In practice, not all branches are present and there is considerable variability
in the branching structure of different inflorescences. It is unusual to have 
flowers of rank greater than 5. Inflorescence structure is important
agronomically, because the size and weight of the strawberry generally
decreases with rank.
</p>

the model described by Ridout, Morgan and Taylor [3].

<p>
Ridout, Morgan and Taylor [Ref 1] proposed a model for inflorescence structure
in which
branching is determined by two parameters, &#955; and &#961;.
Let <i>L</i> and <i>R</i> be indicator variables for the presence of the 
left and right branches from a given parent branch, i.e. <i>L</i>=1 if the left
branch is present and <i>L</i>=0 if it is absent; <i>R</i> is defined 
similarly. Then 
<br>
&#955; = Pr(<i>L</i>=1) = Pr(<i>R</i>=1).
<br>
and the parameter &#961; is the correlation between the binary variables
<i>L</i> and <i>R</i>. 
</p>


<p>
In general, the parameters &#955; and &#961; vary with rank and may also
depend on the total number of flowers present at the previous rank. There
is also evidence that parameter values for the first inflorescence produced by  a
plant differ from those of subsequent inflorescences [Ref 1]. 

<p>
As part of her EPSRC-funded PhD, 
<a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics-actuarial-science/people/417/cole-diana">Diana Cole</a>
extended the original model firstly 
to incorporate covariate effects (e.g. to allow comparisons of 
varieties) and secondly to incorporate random effects, to model
variability in overall vigour between inflorescences [Refs 2 & 3].

      The figure above shows a complete inflorescence with maximum rank 4. There is a single rank 1 flower,
      two rank 2 flowers, four rank 3 flowers and eight rank 4 flowers.
      Complete inflorescences are seldom observed in cultivated strawberries.
      </p>
      <p>
      The figure below shows an incomplete inflorescence that is more typical of inflorescences
      found in the field; several rank 3 and 4 flowers are missing.
