<h3>The R package <tt>overlap</tt>
</h3>
<br>
<p>
The software that I originally provided is preserved 
<a href="old_overlap_software.html">here</a> but has now been
superceded by the R package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/overlap/index.html">overlap</a> 
that is available on CRAN. 
<!-- the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">Comprehensive R Archive Network</a>. -->
</p>

<p>
The package was written by 
<a href="https://mikemeredithtrust.com/about/">Mike Meredith</a> (opposite), who made many additions and
improvements to the software.
Mike died in 2023, leaving a remarkable legacy of widely used software. An
<a href="overview.pdf">
overview</a> of the package [Ref 2], which though technically co-authored was largely written by
Mike, has almost 400 citations on Google Scholar, and [Ref 1] has over 1700 citations,
largely due to the availability of the overlap package.
</p>

<p>
Mike was also passionate about education and invariably provided prompt and extremely
helpful responses to queries about the software from around the world. 
This <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.12979">obituary</a>
describes some of Mike's many contributions and highlights the low key way in which he
preferred to operate, something I also experienced with his work on the <tt>overlap</tt> package.
</p>

<p>
The overlap package is currently maintained by Liz Campbell 
</p>
