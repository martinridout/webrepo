<h3>Estimating overlap of activity patterns
</h3>

<p> 
In Ref [2] <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eq5SM5kAAAAJ&hl=en">Matt Linkie</a> 
and I looked at overlap of activity patterns of the Sumatran tiger (below) with 
several of its prey species, using statistical methodology outlined in [Ref 1]
The data consist of times of day of photographs of different species, from
camera trap records. These data are used to estimate the activity pattern 
of each species over the day (as a probability density function) and then,
for a given pair of species, the degree of overlap between the two estimated 
densities can be estimated, using methods from [Ref 5].
</p>

<p>
The figure on the right shows the overlap between tiger and muntjac, which was the
species that showed the greatest degree of overlap - estimated as 0.80, with a 95%
confidence interval (0.71, 0.84) [Ref 2]. 
The red and blue lines are the estimated activity patterns of each species and the
overlap is calculated as the area of the grey shaded region.

<p>
The statistical methodology is described in [Ref 1] and [Ref 2] below. 
The data consist of times of day of photographs of different species, from
camera trap records. These
data are used to estimate the activity pattern of each species over the day (as a probability 
density function) and then, for a given pair of species, the 
degree of overlap between the two estimated densities can be estimated.

<h4>Statistical method</h4><br>
<p>
In statistical terminology, time of day records
are an example of <i>circular data</i>. 
Activity patterns are obtained either by kernel density estimation
or by fitting a flexible parametric family of circular distributions called
trigonometric sum distributions [Ref 3]. These two approaches usually give very similar
results and only the more flexible kernel density estimation is implemented in the software
described below.
</p>
<p>
The measure of overlap used is the <i>coefficient of overlapping</i> [Ref 4], 
which is the area under the 
curve that is formed by taking
the minimum of the two density functions at each time point. 
This is denoted by &Delta; in the papers and can range
from 0 (no overlap, e.g. one species entirely diurnal, the other entirely 
nocturnal) to 1 (complete overlap, identical activity patterns). A useful
interpretation is that for any time period during the day, the proportion
of activity that occurs during that period differs between the two species
by less than 1-&Delta;.
