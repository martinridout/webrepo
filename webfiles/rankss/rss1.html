<h2>Ranked Set Sampling</h2>


<p>
Ranked set sampling is an alternative to simple random sampling
that can sometimes offer large improvements in precision. It was 
originally proposed in connection with estimating herbage yield
in a paper by G A McIntyre [Ref 1].
In recent years it has been applied particularly to problems in
environmental science. Much of the early literature
is summarised in the monograph by Chen, Bai & Sinha
[Ref 2]. 
An <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.5402/2012/568385">open 
access review paper</a> from 2012 lists over 250 references. 
[Ref 3].
</p>

<p>
I first came across this technique many years ago, also in
connection with estimating herbage yield [Refs 4,5].
A few years later I became interested in ranked set sampling again,
after I
was involved in an evaluation of the method for estimating
spray deposits on the leaves of fruit trees. This page provides
a brief description of this work with links to publications and 
original data.
</p>

<h2>Estimating spray deposits</h2>

<p>
The variable of 
interest here is the spray deposit per unit area of leaf. This
is moderately time consuming to measure precisely, but if leaves
are sprayed with a flourescent dye, the resulting deposits can
be ranked visually under ultraviolet light. An example image is
shown on the right.
</p>

<h3>Evaluation study</h3>

<p>
For our evaluation study we used two different sprayer settings, and
sampled 125 leaves from each. In the lab, each set of 125 was randomly
divided into 25 sets of 5. Four different rankers then ranked both
the upper and the lower leaf surfaces in each set. This was repeated
with a different randomization, to give a large amount of information
about ranking errors.
</p>

<p>
For this evaluation study, all leaves were measured. To obtain the 
'true' measurement for each leaf surface, we used an image analysis system to
obtain a total pixel grey-scale value. This was then divided by
the leaf area to give a measure of deposit density.
</p>

<p>
This study was done with Dr Roy Murray of East Malling Research.
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>
In this study, two factors reduce the potential benefits of ranked 
set sampling in relation to simple random sampling:
<p>* the cost of collecting additional leaves and ranking them;</p>
<p>* errors that arise in the ranking process</p>
</p>

<p>
When these factors are taken into account, the relative precision
of ranked set sampling is estimated to be about 1.5 - in other
words about 50% more samples would be needed to achieve
the same precision using ordinary random sampling.
</p>

<p>
There was reasonable consistency between the different rankers
(Kendall's coefficient of concordance was about 0.9) and estimates
of relative precision were similar for all four rankers. Nor was
there any great difference in relative precision between the upper 
and lower leaf surfaces or between the two different sprayer settings.
A more detailed description of this work was published as a 
<a href="AABPaper.pdf">conference paper</a>. 
</p>

as a text file.
</p>

<p>
In an 
<a HREF="Ranking_Errors.pdf">unpublished paper</a> 
I have used a generalisation of Mallows' model to explore the 
ranking errors made by the four rankers [Ref 7].
</p>

<h3>Multiple measurements</h3>

<p>
A specific problem that arises with spray deposits is the need
to collect data for both leaf surfaces. Deposits on the two surfaces
tend to be weakly negatively correlated - if the leaf happens to be
orientated so that one surface receives a lot of spray, the other
surface tends to receive a low deposit. 
</p>

<p>
If leaves are selected on the basis of their ranking on just one 
surface, the resulting sample may be very unbalanced with respect 
to its ranking on the other surface. This leads to a loss of efficiency.
However, a simple hueristic algorithm, which can be implemented 
without too much additional effort, ensures that the leaves measured 
are reasonably balanced with respect to their ranks on both surfaces. 
</p>

<p>
I gave a short talk about this work at the very
enjoyable, SPRUCE Advanced Workshop on <I>Environmental
Sampling and Monitoring</I> held in
Estoril, Portugal on 22-24 March 2001. A 
<a href="multiple.pdf">written version</a> 
was subsequently published in <i>Environmental & Ecological
Statistics</i> [Ref 8].

<h3>Spray deposits</h3>

<p>
  The image below shows the
  spray deposit on the upper surface of a leaf of an apple tree. Sets of 5 leaves were
  ranked visually for ranked set sampling. The upper and lower leaf
  surfaces were ranked separately.
