<h3>Estimating overlap of activity patterns
</h3>

<p> 
In Ref [2] <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eq5SM5kAAAAJ&hl=en">Matt Linkie</a> 
and I looked at overlap of activity patterns of the Sumatran tiger (below) with 
several of its prey species, using statistical methodology outlined in [Ref 1]
The data consist of times of day of photographs of different species, from
camera trap records. These data are used to estimate the activity pattern 
of each species over the day (as a probability density function) and then,
for a given pair of species, the degree of overlap between the two estimated 
densities can be estimated, using methods from [Ref 5].
</p>

<p>
The figure on the right shows the overlap between tiger and muntjac, which was the
species that showed the greatest degree of overlap - estimated as 0.80, with a 95%
confidence interval (0.71, 0.84) [Ref 2]. 
The red and blue lines are the estimated activity patterns of each species and the
overlap is calculated as the area of the grey shaded region.

<p>
The statistical methodology is described in [Ref 1] and [Ref 2] below. 
The data consist of times of day of photographs of different species, from
camera trap records. These
data are used to estimate the activity pattern of each species over the day (as a probability 
density function) and then, for a given pair of species, the 
degree of overlap between the two estimated densities can be estimated.
</p>
-->

<h4>Statistical method</h4><br>
<p>
In statistical terminology, time of day records
are an example of <i>circular data</i>. 
Activity patterns are obtained either by kernel density estimation
or by fitting a flexible parametric family of circular distributions called
trigonometric sum distributions [Ref 3]. These two approaches usually give very similar
results and only the more flexible kernel density estimation is implemented in the software
described below.
</p>
<p>
The measure of overlap used is the <i>coefficient of overlapping</i> [Ref 4], 
which is the area under the 
curve that is formed by taking
the minimum of the two density functions at each time point. 
This is denoted by &Delta; in the papers and can range
from 0 (no overlap, e.g. one species entirely diurnal, the other entirely 
nocturnal) to 1 (complete overlap, identical activity patterns). A useful
interpretation is that for any time period during the day, the proportion
of activity that occurs during that period differs between the two species
by less than 1-&Delta;. 
</p>

<h4>R software</h4><br>
<p>
The software that I originally provided is preserved 
<a href="old_overlap_software.html">here</a> but has now been
superceded by the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/overlap/index.html"><tt>overlap</tt>
package</a> that is available from  the
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">Comprehensive R Archive Network</a>.
</p>

<p>
The package was written by 
<a href="https://mikemeredithtrust.com/about/">Mike Meredith</a>, who made many 
improvements to the software.
Mike died in 2023, leaving a remarkable legacy of widely used software. An
<a href="webfiles/overlap/overview.pdf">
overview</a> of the package, which though technically co-authored was largely written by
Mike, has almost 400 citations on Google Scholar, and [Ref 1] has over 1700 citations,
largely due to the availability of the package.
</p>

<p>
Mike was also passionate about education and invariably provided prompt and extremely
helpful responses to queries about the software from around the world. This <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.12979">obituary</a>
describes some of Mike's many contributions and highlights the low key way in which he
preferred to operate, something I also experienced with his work on the <tt>overlap</tt> package.

This page provides R programs to estimate the degree of overlap
between the activity patterns of two species, based on camera trap 
data. R is a free statistics package available from the
</p>

<h4>Implementation in R</h4><br>
<p>
The data from [Ref 2] are in file 
<a href="webfiles/overlap/traptimes.txt">traptimes.txt</a>. The file
<a href="webfiles/overlap/setup.r">setup.r</a> reads the data into R
and also imports a set of functions that are used in the 
analyses (these functions are in the file 
<a href="webfiles/overlap/ovlcode.r">ovlcode.r</a>).
</p>
<p>
The file 
<a href="webfiles/overlap/example.r">example.r</a> provides simple
examples of how to estimate overlap, including a bootstrap confidence
interval. To run the example (which should take less than a minute on a 
modern PC), follow these steps:<br>
<ul>
<li>
copy ALL the R files and the data file into a directory on your computer
</li>
<li>
start R and click on File|Change dir... to select the directory where you stored the files
</li>
<li>
At the R prompt (> ) type <br>
<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp source("example.r")</tt>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The files 
<a href="webfiles/overlap/figure1.r">figure1.r</a> and
<a href="webfiles/overlap/figure2.r">figure2.r</a> produce the two
figures in ref [2]. These files are included for the benefit of 
anyone interested in producing similar graphs, but they are not
extensively commented.
